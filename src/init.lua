	TODO@BASIC - Set up Remote through RemoteComm by listing functions
		Needs a "variable scope" thing? Shared table between
		functions that is used by client/server

	TODO@OPTIM/FINISHME - Make useNativeClientScript insert Client.lua automatically
	
	
	# ]} WELCOME TheatR! {[
	
	TheatR compiles KeyframeSequence data into
	custom objects called AnimationSequence that
	save loading time for Animations.
	
	The code was made to save time and doesn't
	have much compatibility with other packages. (sorry :[)
	because i decided to not learn how to create
	roblox package repositories at the time üëç
	
	A few configurations are available in this
	script's Attributes.
	
	The comments utilize Nerd Font symbols.
	
	
	# ] External Version [
	
	To use the external module version, use:
	```
	require(ID_HERE)()
	```
	
	A table can be used as an argument and it sets
	the module's configurations.
	
	Example:
	```
	require(ID_HERE)
		{
			useNativeClientScript = true
		}
	```
	
	
	# ]| HOW DO I USE THIS THING? {[
	
	TheatR is an API and you'll be managing ani-
	mations through the master module (this one).
